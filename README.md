## Adding New Tribal Languages

Jal Rakshak is designed to be easily extensible for tribal languages. To add a new language:

### Step 1: Create a new language file
Create a new JSON file in `src/locales/` named with the language code (e.g., `mizo.json`, `khasi.json`).

### Step 2: Add translations
Copy the structure from `src/locales/en.json` and translate all the keys. For reference, see:
- `src/locales/en.json` - English (base)
- `src/locales/hi.json` - Hindi 
- `src/locales/as.json` - Assamese
- `src/locales/bodo.json` - Bodo (sample implementation)

### Step 3: Register the language
In `src/i18n.ts`:
1. Import your new language file:
   ```typescript
   import mizo from './locales/mizo.json';
   ```

2. Add it to the resources object:
   ```typescript
   const resources = {
     // ... existing languages
     mizo: {
       translation: mizo
     }
   };
   ```

### Step 4: Add to language selector
In `src/components/LanguageToggle.tsx`, add a new SelectItem:
```jsx
<SelectItem value="mizo">{t('mizo')}</SelectItem>
```

### Step 5: Add language name translation
Add the language name to all translation files:
```json
{
  "mizo": "Mizo á¹­awng"
}
```

### Language Structure
Each language file should include translations for:
- App metadata (name, description)
- Authentication flows
- Dashboard interfaces  
- Role descriptions
- Forms and inputs
- Health education content
- Water quality metrics
- Symptoms and water sources
- Offline functionality
- SMS features

### Note for Tribal Languages
When adding tribal languages, consider:
- Use appropriate scripts (Devanagari, Latin, etc.)
- Include cultural context in health education
- Adapt terminology for local understanding
- Test with native speakers
- Consider right-to-left languages if applicable
